Associates degree in web development from Southeast Community College and studied 
software engineering at the university of nebraska lincoln

I've done many software projects from computer apps to mobile apps to web apps, and I always found myself drifting towards web 
development, which is where I do most of my work now. I started creating websites when I was bartending, the bar I was working for 
was in need of one so I made it during downtime when we were slow. After that I began searching around to local
websites and noticed how outdated and often times unusable so many local sites were and decided I could do it better, and that is how
I began my freelance web development.
